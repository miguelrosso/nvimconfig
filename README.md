# nvimconfig
my current nvim config files

# installation
pull into config path + run `:Lazy`

# single file config vs structured paths
i personally prefer to keep all configs as simple as possible, and one file config is what works best for my head because of it.
it also helps me try to keep crazy modifications to vim to a (usable) minimum which also helps my sanity down the line.
